Understanding the Grid Dimensions in the HeroContainer
The grid system in the HeroContainer component uses CSS Grid Layout with configurable dimensions. Let me explain the parameters and their minimum and maximum values:
Column and Row Count

Columns: Default is 12 (similar to Bootstrap's grid system)

Min: 1 column
Max: No technical limit, but practically 24 is usually the upper bound for usability
Common values: 12 for general layouts, 16 for more granular control


Rows: Default is 6

Min: 1 row
Max: No technical limit
Common values: 4-8 rows for typical hero sections



Grid Positioning Values
When using the gridClasses property in HeroGridItem:
Column Start (col-start-{n})

Min: 1 (starting from the left edge)
Max: Equal to the number of columns (12 by default)

Column Span (col-span-{n})

Min: 1 (occupying a single column)
Max: Equal to the number of columns (12 by default)
Special value: col-span-full to span all columns

Row Start (row-start-{n})

Min: 1 (starting from the top edge)
Max: Equal to the number of rows (6 by default)

Row Span (row-span-{n})

Min: 1 (occupying a single row)
Max: Equal to the number of rows (6 by default)
Special value: row-span-full to span all rows

Tailwind Classes Format
In Tailwind CSS, the grid classes follow this pattern:

col-start-{n}: Where n is the starting grid line (1 to columns+1)
col-span-{n}: Where n is the number of columns to span (1 to columns)
row-start-{n}: Where n is the starting grid line (1 to rows+1)
row-span-{n}: Where n is the number of rows to span (1 to rows)

Responsive Considerations
For responsive designs:

Use Tailwind's responsive prefixes: sm:, md:, lg:, xl:, 2xl:
Example: col-span-12 md:col-span-6 lg:col-span-4
This creates a 12-column wide element on mobile, 6-column on tablet, and 4-column on desktop

Practical Constraints
When setting up your grid, keep these practical constraints in mind:

The sum of col-start and col-span should not exceed (columns + 1)

Example: If col-start-8 and columns=12, col-span can be at most 5


The sum of row-start and row-span should not exceed (rows + 1)

Example: If row-start-4 and rows=6, row-span can be at most 3


Elements can overlap if their grid areas intersect, so plan your layout carefully

Best Practices

Start simple with fewer rows and columns (like 12Ã—6) until you're comfortable
Use even numbers for columns (12, 16, 24) to make divisions easier
Plan your responsive breakpoints carefully to avoid layout shifts
Consider using named grid areas for more complex layouts
